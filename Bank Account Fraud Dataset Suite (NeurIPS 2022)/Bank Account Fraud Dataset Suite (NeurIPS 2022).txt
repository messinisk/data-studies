About Dataset
The Bank Account Fraud (BAF) suite of datasets has been published at NeurIPS 2022 and it comprises a total of 6 different synthetic bank account fraud tabular datasets. BAF is a realistic, complete, and robust test bed to evaluate novel and existing methods in ML and fair ML, and the first of its kind!

This suite of datasets is:

Realistic, based on a present-day real-world dataset for fraud detection;
Biased, each dataset has distinct controlled types of bias;
Imbalanced, this setting presents a extremely low prevalence of positive class;
Dynamic, with temporal data and observed distribution shifts;
Privacy preserving, to protect the identity of potential applicants we have applied differential privacy techniques (noise addition), feature encoding and trained a generative model (CTGAN).






Each dataset is composed of:

1 million instances;
30 realistic features used in the fraud detection use-case;
A column of “month”, providing temporal information about the dataset;
Protected attributes, (age group, employment status and % income).
